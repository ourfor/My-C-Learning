- Which IDE(integrated development environments) I use? I use Qt and g++, but I often use g++ which isn't a IDE. As you can see VC need about 6G. However we need not use all of this tool.
- Which book I use to learn C++ language? Proclaim: In our class, only me use this book  ***C++ Prime Plus*** .
- You can use macOS and Windows to compile source code. Linux is also a good choice.

> Because I like using Command line and prefer to sample GUI, I use macOS and Ubuntu instead of the popular operation system, Windows. It means that I am not familian with command line in Windows.

At the same time, you can install oh-my-zsh which is useful.(I installed zsh and powerline-theme.)

## macOS and linux platform 
As you can see I use Terminal and g++ to compile source code. Here are some detials on how to make a file which includes source code and how to compile it.

 > Step 1 :
 make files
 
 Open the Terminal, and enter the following command line    
 
 ```bash
 cd ~/Documents     # change directory to "Documents"
 mkdir C++_Project   # make directory C++_Project ps. you can rename it
 cd ~/C++_Project    # change directory C++_Project
 touch xxx.cpp      # make file to save source code Notice： "xxx" is the name of this file , you can name it what you want.
 ```

> Step 2 :
Edit the file you make

In command line, you can use ` vi `、` vim `、and ` nano `, I don't like use those. I use ` Sublime text3 `and ` Textmate ` 
(I recommanded you install airline if you like using vim)

> Step 3 :
Compile the source code

Making sure that you have install *g++* or *gcc*, In the Terminal, you can enter this command line ` gcc -version ` to know which version you have installed.         

Changing directory to where your source code file is. And then use this command line - ` g++ xxx.cpp ` to compile source code.
The "xxx.cpp" is the name of your source code file.    

Then, entering ` ls `,you can see a new file which name is "a.out". Last use command line ` ./a.out ` to run it.  

> Notice: We use gcc/g++ to compile source code. Some detials is very important. 

|type|extension|
|:-:|:-:|
|C|.c|
|C++|.cpp|

You can also download the sources code of gcc and compile it.Sometime the version , which the system installed is too old,and you compile some projects that need heigh version to compile,you can do this.

## As for Windows platform  
You can install IDE , such as Code::Blocks 、 Qt
